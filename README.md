# Spam Classifier for Emails and SMS Messages

## Overview

This project focuses on building a spam classifier that can identify spam messages in both emails and SMS. The system is developed using machine learning techniques and is deployed on Heroku for reliable spam detection.

## Project Stages

1. **Data Collection and Preparation**

   - Utilized the UCI Machine Learning dataset to gather data for both emails and SMS messages.
   - Performed data cleaning to handle missing values and inconsistencies.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   - Conducted EDA to understand data distribution and identify patterns.
   - Visualized data to gain insights into message characteristics.

3. **Text Preprocessing**

   - Applied text preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
   - Prepared the data for model building.

4. **Model Building**

   - Developed a spam classification model using various machine learning algorithms.
   - Experimented with different models and hyperparameters to optimize performance.

5. **Model Improvement**

   - Enhanced model performance by tuning hyperparameters and using feature engineering techniques.

6. **Project Development**

   - Created and organized the project in PyCharm, ensuring code efficiency and modularity.

7. **Deployment**
   - Deployed the final model on Heroku, providing a web-based interface for spam detection.
